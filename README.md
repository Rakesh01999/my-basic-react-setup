# My Basic React Setup (sample setup project)
This repository contains a basic React setup using Vite with TypeScript. It is designed to serve as a starter template for React projects, providing a fast and efficient development environment.

## Features
- **React + TypeScript**: Build scalable and type-safe applications.
- **Vite**: Lightning-fast development environment with modern tooling.
- **Organized Folder Structure**: Streamlined project setup for easier maintenance.
- **Customizable**: Easily extendable to suit your project requirements.

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v14.18.0 or higher recommended)
- **npm** or **yarn** (npm comes pre-installed with Node.js)

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. **Create the Vite Project**:
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest
   ```
   - **Project Name**: `my-basic-react-setup`

   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open the provided local server URL in your browser to view the project.

## Folder Structure
The project is organized as follows:
```
my-basic-react-setup/
├── public/          # Static files (e.g., favicons, static images)
├── src/             # Source code
│   ├── assets/      # Images, icons, etc.
│   ├── components/  # Reusable components
│   ├── pages/       # Page-specific components
│   ├── styles/      # Global CSS or Tailwind config
│   ├── App.tsx      # Main App component
│   ├── index.tsx    # Entry point
├── .gitignore       # Files and directories to ignore in Git
├── README.md        # Project documentation
├── package.json     # Project metadata and dependencies
├── vite.config.ts   # Vite configuration
```

## .gitignore
The `.gitignore` file ensures unnecessary files are not tracked in Git:
```gitignore
# Node modules
node_modules/

# Build output
dist/

# Logs
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*

# System files
.DS_Store

# IDE files
.vscode/
*.idea
```

## Usage
Once the project is set up, you can start building your application by:
- Adding reusable components in the `src/components/` folder.
- Structuring pages in the `src/pages/` folder.
- Including assets like images or icons in the `src/assets/` folder.
- Writing global styles in the `src/styles/` folder.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
